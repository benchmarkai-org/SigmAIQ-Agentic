{initial_response}

Please review this response considering the following aspects:

1. Detection Logic Validation
- Have I correctly translated the user's detection intent into Sigma syntax?
- Are the selected field names valid for the specified log source?
- Could this detection generate false positives? If so, have I added appropriate filters?
- Does the condition logic accurately combine selections and filters?
- Have I considered common evasion techniques that might bypass this detection?

2. Log Source Assessment
- Is the logsource configuration specific enough?
- Have I specified all required fields (category, product, service)?
- Will this rule work across different log formats for the specified source?

3. Context Integration
- If I used existing rules as reference:
  * Have I properly credited original authors?
  * Have I correctly specified related rule IDs?
  * Is the relationship type (derived, similar, etc.) accurate?
  * Have I improved upon or differentiated from existing rules?

4. Rule Metadata Completeness
- Is the title clear and descriptive?
- Does the description explain the detection's purpose and potential threats?
- Are all relevant tags included for proper categorization?
- Have I specified an appropriate severity level?
- Are false positive scenarios documented?
- Have I included relevant references?

5. Technical Coverage
- Does this rule cover all relevant variations of the attack/behavior?
- Have I considered different OS platforms if applicable?
- Are there edge cases I should address?

Based on this analysis:
1. What improvements are needed to the above rule?
2. What additional context or filters would make it more accurate?
3. How can we reduce false positives while maintaining effectiveness?

Please provide your response in the following format:
1. Analysis of the initial rule
2. The improved Sigma rule in a code block
3. Explanation of improvements made"""
